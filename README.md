TODO

NOTE: we've intentionally made design decisions to build these simulations faster with the tradeoff that these policies will need to be modified if they are to be used in other simulations.
If you'd like to use this code for your work, and would like help modifying it, please just contact me at jfuruness@gmail.com and I'd be happy to walk you through it.

Otherwise we're going to move forward with the assumption that this code will only ever be used for reproducibility purposes, and due to time constraints won't put the extra effort in to make these extendable.
